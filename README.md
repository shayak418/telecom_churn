# Telecom Churn

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning models. By analyzing a dataset spanning four months, we identify behavioral patterns leading to churn and propose business strategies for retention.

Key Steps & Findings:
ðŸ“Œ Business Context: Telecoms face a 15-25% annual churn rate, making customer retention a top priority.
ðŸ“Œ Dataset: 99,999 records, 226 featuresâ€”tracking customer usage and recharge trends.
ðŸ“Œ EDA & Preprocessing: Addressed missing values, removed outliers, and applied feature selection techniques (RFE, VIF).
ðŸ“Œ Modeling Approach: Logistic Regression selected for its balance of interpretability and accuracy (~86%).
ðŸ“Œ Insights: Low recharge amounts, declining data usage, and inconsistent engagement are strong churn indicators.
ðŸ“Œ Business Recommendations: Targeted promotions, loyalty programs, and proactive customer support can improve retention.

ðŸš€ Outcome: Data-driven churn prediction can reduce revenue loss and boost engagement for telecom providers.
